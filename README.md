# TensorFlow.js - Real-Time Object Detection

## Description

This repository contains two distinct projects exploring the capabilities of TensorFlow.js for machine learning and object detection. Both projects are built using TensorFlow.js and demonstrate different aspects of machine learning, from real-time object detection to model predictions based on input data

## Project 1

- located in app.js file

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a pre-trained COCO-SSD model in TensorFlow.js. The application uses a webcam to detect and classify multiple objects in real-time.

## Project 2

- located in script.js file

This project focuses on model prediction using TensorFlow.js. It involves loading a TensorFlow model and making predictions based on input data. Check the console for output and tensor details.

## Acknowledgments

Both projects were copied from Google Developers and TensorFlow.js tutorials, providing me a practical understanding of machine learning concepts and TensorFlow.js applications.
